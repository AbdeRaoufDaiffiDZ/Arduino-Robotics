## Arduino-Robotics
 **This course is special for taching children about arduino and its deffrent compenents, I use this presentations to teach children between the age of 8 to 16**

> you find in this course:

- basics about electronics and electrical circuits

- basics about the arduino bord digital and analog signals

- PWM pulse width modulation

- how to implement the LDR and potensiometer in simple projects

- Ultrasonic sensor and how to calculate the distance

- DC motors, how its works and its implementation.

- Buetooth module, FTDI,USB, UART, How cand data be transmited from PC to arduino

- MPU6050, gyroscope, accelerometer and how to get data from this module

> due to lack of time I'll try to add more sensors to this course, wait for me soon....!!!
